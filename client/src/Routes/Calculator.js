        <p>A friend once told me "You are not a programmer until you made a calculator". I took this as a challenge and thereby made this calculator. As operators, It supports plus, minus, divide, multiply and percentage. Further, it supports comma (.), backspace, and all-clear (AC).</p>
        <p>There were a lot of small challenges hidden here such as not allowing multiple commas or more that one operator without numbers between, not allowing division by 0 and making multi-display showing the most recent formula while below showing the result.</p>
        <p>I made it to support chaining operations in place of one by one calculation. Currently, it can accept examples like 2 + 22 â€“ 10 + 5 = 19 however it does not yet follow correct rules of math to operate on divide and multiply first. It still operates from left to right one by one.</p>
        <p>Here below you can see a screenshot of the result and you can find the code on Github <a href="https://github.com/MortenEmde/Calculator">Here</a>.</p>
